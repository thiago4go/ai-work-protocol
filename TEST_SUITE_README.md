./run_efficiency_tests.py

# Save results to specific directory
./run_efficiency_tests.py --output-dir results_2024_01_15

# Skip specific test suites
./run_efficiency_tests.py --no-rag    # Skip RAG tests
./run_efficiency_tests.py --no-ux     # Skip UX tests
```

### Individual Test Suites
```bash
# Core system tests only
./test_suite.py

# Specific core test
./test_suite.py --test project_task_workflow

# RAG integration tests only
./test_rag_integration.py

# User experience tests only
./test_user_experience.py
```

### Test Configuration
Edit `test_config.json` to customize:
```json
{
  "performance_thresholds": {
    "max_response_time": 2.0,
    "min_success_rate": 0.8,
    "min_usability_score": 0.7
  },
  "rag_settings": {
    "test_rag_integration": true,
    "rag_timeout": 15
  }
}
```

## Understanding Results

### Efficiency Score (0-100)
Weighted composite score across all dimensions:
- **85-100**: Production Ready ‚úÖ
- **70-84**: Ready with Minor Issues ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **50-69**: Needs Improvement üîß
- **0-49**: Not Ready ‚ùå

### Key Reports Generated

1. **Comprehensive Report** (`efficiency_report_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`)
   - Complete test results and metrics
   - Machine-readable format for automation

2. **Summary Report** (`efficiency_summary_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.md`)
   - Human-readable executive summary
   - Key findings and recommendations

3. **Individual Suite Results** (`*_results_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS.json`)
   - Detailed results for each test suite
   - Useful for debugging specific issues

### Sample Output
```
üéØ FINAL EFFICIENCY ASSESSMENT
======================================================================
Overall Efficiency Score: 78.5/100
System Readiness: Ready with Minor Issues
Critical Issues: 1

Critical Issues:
  ‚ùå Performance bottleneck in project creation (3.2s average)

Top Recommendations:
  1. Optimize project creation performance
  2. Improve error message clarity for new users
  3. Add more template examples for discoverability
```

## Interpreting Metrics

### Core System Metrics
- **System Reliability**: % of commands that execute successfully
- **Performance Score**: Response time quality (< 2s target)
- **Workflow Efficiency**: % of complete workflows that succeed

### RAG Integration Metrics
- **RAG Effectiveness**: Accuracy of memory retrieval and context
- **Memory Operations**: Success rate of store/retrieve operations
- **Knowledge Graph Health**: Connectivity and query performance

### User Experience Metrics
- **Usability Score**: Overall ease of use (0-100%)
- **Friction Points**: Number of user experience issues
- **Cognitive Load**: Mental effort required to use system

## Continuous Testing

### Automated Testing
```bash
# Add to CI/CD pipeline
./run_efficiency_tests.py --quick --output-dir ci_results

# Exit codes:
# 0 = Tests passed (efficiency >= 70%, no critical issues)
# 1 = Tests failed (needs improvement)
# 130 = Tests interrupted
```

### Performance Monitoring
```bash
# Regular health checks
./run_efficiency_tests.py --quick > daily_health.log

# Performance regression testing
./test_suite.py --test performance_benchmarks
```

### Benchmarking
The test suite includes industry-standard benchmarks:
- Response time: < 2.0 seconds
- Reliability: > 95% success rate
- Usability: > 80% satisfaction
- Workflow efficiency: > 85% completion rate

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"RAG system not available"**
- RAG tests are skipped if MCP RAG server isn't running
- System still functions without RAG, but with reduced context

**"Permission denied" errors**
- Run `chmod +x *.py` to make test files executable
- Ensure you have write permissions in the test directory

**Slow test execution**
- Use `--quick` flag for faster testing
- Check system resources and close other applications

**Test failures in CI/CD**
- Ensure test environment has all required dependencies
- Use `--no-rag` if RAG server isn't available in CI

### Getting Help

1. Check test logs in `test_results/` directory
2. Run individual test suites to isolate issues
3. Review the detailed JSON reports for specific error messages
4. Ensure all dependencies are installed via `setup_tests.sh`

## Extending the Test Suite

### Adding New Tests
1. Create test methods in appropriate test class
2. Follow naming convention: `test_your_feature_name`
3. Return `TestResult` or `UXTestResult` objects
4. Add to test runner in `run_all_*_tests()` method

### Custom Metrics
Add custom metrics to the `efficiency_metrics` dictionary in test results.

### Integration with Other Tools
The JSON output format is designed for integration with:
- CI/CD pipelines
- Monitoring dashboards
- Performance tracking systems
- Quality gates

## Best Practices

1. **Run tests regularly** - Daily health checks catch issues early
2. **Baseline performance** - Establish performance baselines for regression testing
3. **Monitor trends** - Track efficiency scores over time
4. **Fix critical issues first** - Address high-risk issues before optimizations
5. **Test in realistic conditions** - Use representative data and workflows
