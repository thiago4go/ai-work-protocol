# Memory System Makefile - Work Management Commands
# =====================================================
# This Makefile provides commands for managing work using the PROJECT‚ÜíTASK‚ÜíSTEP hierarchy.
# All commands integrate with RAG memory for persistent context and learning.

.PHONY: status list project task done dashboard help

# Show current work status
# ------------------------
# Displays active project/task, progress, and AI guidance for next actions.
# Always run this first to understand current state.
#
# Usage:
#   make status
#
# Example output:
#   üìä Memory System Status
#   üéØ PROJECT: Build User Auth
#   üìã TASK: Implement Login Flow
#      Progress: 3/5 steps completed
#      Current: Add password validation
#   ü§ñ AI NEXT ACTIONS:
#      1. Load step context: rag_memory___hybridSearch query='password validation patterns'
#      2. Work on current step...
status:
	@scripts/status.sh

# List available templates
# ------------------------
# Shows all project and task templates with descriptions.
# Use this to see what types of work are supported.
#
# Usage:
#   make list
#
# Example output:
#   üìö Templates Available:
#   PROJECTs:
#     - standard      ‚Üí Building features
#     - refactor      ‚Üí Improve code quality
#     - bugfix        ‚Üí Fix production issues
#   TASKs:
#     - discovery     ‚Üí Research before building
#     - implementation ‚Üí Build defined solution
list:
	@scripts/create.sh list

# Create new project
# ------------------
# Starts a new high-level project. Only one project can be active at a time.
# Default template is 'standard'. See 'make list' for all templates.
#
# Usage:
#   make project title="Your Project Name"
#   make project template=bugfix title="Fix Login Error"
#
# Examples:
#   make project title="Build User Authentication"
#   make project template=refactor title="Improve Database Layer"
#   make project template=investigation title="Should we use GraphQL?"
#
# Note: Query RAG first to see if similar projects exist:
#   rag_memory___searchNodes query="type:project similar:authentication"
project:
	@scripts/create.sh project $(or $(template),standard) "$(title)"

# Create new task
# ---------------
# Creates a task within the current project. Only one task can be active at a time.
# Default template is 'discovery'. Tasks should complete in 1-3 days.
#
# Usage:
#   make task title="Your Task Name"
#   make task template=implementation title="Build Login Form"
#
# Examples:
#   make task title="Research Auth Libraries"
#   make task template=debugging title="Find Memory Leak"
#   make task template=poc title="Test Redis Performance"
#   make task template=documentation title="Write API Docs"
#
# Note: Task will auto-link to current project. Query RAG for context:
#   rag_memory___hybridSearch query="login form best practices"
task:
	@scripts/create.sh task $(or $(template),discovery) "$(title)"

# Complete current task
# ---------------------
# Marks the current task as complete, moves to completed/, and updates project.
# Run this only when ALL steps in the task are done.
#
# Usage:
#   make done
#   make done name=specific-task.md
#
# Before running:
#   - Ensure all steps show #status:completed
#   - Update CURRENT_IMPLEMENTATION.md with final metrics
#   - Add findings to CRITICAL_FINDINGS.md index (1 line each)
#   - Store full findings in RAG per protocol:
#     rag_memory___createEntities entities=[{
#       "name": "finding_[date]_[slug]",
#       "type": "critical_finding",
#       "properties": {"finding": "...", "context": "...", "impact": "...", "solution": "..."}
#     }]
done:
	@scripts/complete.sh $(name)

# Show visual dashboard
# ---------------------
# Displays progress visualization, metrics, and work history.
# Useful for understanding patterns and velocity.
#
# Usage:
#   make dashboard
#   make dashboard days=30  # Show last 30 days
#
# Shows:
#   - Current sprint progress
#   - Velocity trends
#   - Common blockers
#   - Time estimates vs actuals
dashboard:
	@scripts/dashboard.sh

# Show backlog items
# ------------------
# Lists all projects and tasks waiting in the backlog.
# Items are automatically added to backlog when WIP limit is reached.
#
# Usage:
#   make backlog
#
# Example output:
#   üìã Backlog (3 items)
#   ‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

# Activate item from backlog
# --------------------------
# Moves a backlog item to active (inprogress), respecting WIP limits.
# Will swap with current active item if at limit.
#
# Usage:
#   make activate file=2024-01-15_refactor-auth.md
#   make activate file=refactor-auth  # partial match ok
#
# Rules:
#   - Only 1 project and 1 task can be active
#   - Activating a project when one exists will swap them
#   - Activating a task when one exists will swap them
#   - Cannot activate a task without an active project
#
# Example:
#   # Current: "Build Auth" project active
#   make activate file=fix-bug-project
#   # Result: "Build Auth" ‚Üí backlog, "Fix Bug" ‚Üí active

# AI suggestions for next action
# -------------------------------
# Provides intelligent suggestions based on current state and RAG memory.
# Analyzes patterns, blockers, and successful approaches.
#
# Usage:
#   make suggest
#
# The AI will:
#   1. Query RAG for relevant patterns and past solutions
#   2. Analyze current blockers and progress
#   3. Suggest specific next actions
#   4. Provide relevant RAG queries to execute
#
# Example suggestions:
#   - "Similar task took 2x estimate due to API complexity"
#   - "Pattern detected: Morning sessions more productive"
#   - "Blocker 'auth timeout' solved previously with retry logic"

# Create checkpoint of current state
# ----------------------------------
# Saves complete work state to RAG for recovery or context switching.
# Use before stopping work, switching tasks, or at natural break points.
#
# Usage:
#   make checkpoint
#   make checkpoint reason="Switching to urgent bug"
#
# Creates:
#   - RAG document with full context
#   - Entity tracking checkpoint metadata
#   - Git commit for version control
#
# To restore from checkpoint:
#   rag_memory___searchNodes query="type:checkpoint" 
#   rag_memory___getDocument id="checkpoint_[timestamp]"

# Extract and store learnings
# ---------------------------
# Analyzes recent work to identify patterns, estimate accuracy, and solutions.
# Run after completing tasks or when patterns emerge.
#
# Usage:
#   make learn
#   make learn focus="estimation accuracy"
#
# Extracts:
#   - Duration patterns (estimated vs actual)
#   - Common blockers and solutions
#   - Successful approaches to reuse
#   - Meta-patterns across similar work
#
# Example learnings:
#   - "Database migrations take 2.5x estimate on average"
#   - "Integration tests fail when run in parallel"
#   - "POCs with UI mockups get approved 80% vs 30%"

# Query findings from RAG
# -----------------------
# Searches for critical findings and lessons learned.
# The CRITICAL_FINDINGS.md file only contains an index - full data is in RAG.
#
# Usage:

#   make findings keyword=bootstrap  # Search specific topic
#   make findings type=blocker      # Filter by type
#
# Examples:
#   make findings keyword=estimation
#   make findings keyword="test failures"
#   make findings type=pattern
#
# Finding types:
#   - critical_finding: Major discoveries or issues
#   - lesson: Patterns and learnings
#   - blocker: Things that stopped progress
#   - pattern: Recurring behaviors
